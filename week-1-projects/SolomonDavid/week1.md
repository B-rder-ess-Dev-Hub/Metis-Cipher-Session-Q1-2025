<h2>Week 1A Tasks</h2>
<br>

<h3>Part One</h3>
<h4>Applications of Blockchain in Industry<h4>
<ul>
<li> <b> Delivery systems: </b> Blockchain technology enables the immutability of tracking data and other logistical information on goods being transported.</li>
<li> <b> Financial institutions: </b> Blockchain technologies allow for greater security, peer-to-peer transactions, and non-repudiation of transactions. </li>
<li> <b> Healthcare systems: </b> The blockchain allows for safer storage and management of patient data. </li>
<li> <b> Electorial systems: </b> The blockchain allows for casted votes to be unaltered in order to avoid what happened in Nigeria in 2023. </li>
<li> <b> Security systems: </b> The blockchain would make it possible for events and documented incidents to remain unaltered and open to future review. </li>
<li> <b> Real Estate: </b> The blockchain would make it easier to carry out background and ownership checks on immovable properties and reduce the rate of land-purchase scams. </li>
<li> <b> Content Creation: </b> Blockchain Technology would reduce the rate of censorship and control of content by third-parties in the social media space. </li>
<li> <b> Legal Activities: </b> The blockchain would make it nearly impossible to modify and tamper with legal documents. </li>
<li> <b> Education: </b> The blockchain would make it easier to monitor the performances of students and guard against malpractical activities like illegal score modification. 
<li> <b> Paternity: </b> With the blockchain, cases of paternity fraud can be reduced as DNA tests taken at the hospital can not be denied or modified later on (wahala for women). 
</ul>

<h3> Part Two </h3>
<h4> Components of A Blockchain Network </h4>
<ol>
<li> <b>Nodes:</b> These are computers on the Ethereum network that validate transactions and store data. </li>
<li> <b> Smart Contracts: </b> These are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain. They execute their tasks whenever some conditions are met.</li>
<li> <b> Ethereum Virtual Machine: </b> This is the runtime environment for smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain </li>
<li> <b> Blocks: </b> These are transactions that have been performed on the network have been stored. </li>
<li> <b> Consensus Mechanisms: </b>These are protocols used to validate blocks on the blockchain. They may involve solving complex problems (Proof of Work) or stake currencies (Proof of Stake).</li>
</ol>

<h4> How To Track a Transaction on Etherscan.com</h4>
<ol>
<li> Go to etherscan.com. </li>
<li> Paste the name of a Token, Hash, Wallet Address, etc. in the search bar and search. </li>
<li> You'll be shown details like the creators name, gas fees, transaction fees, etc. </li>
</ol>

<h3> Part Three </h3>
<h4> Importance of Decentralization in Blockchain. </h4>
<p> Decentralization is very important in Blockchain because it
<ul>
<li> Ensures there is no central authority controlling the transaction.</li>
<li> The data is stored on multiple computers, making it harder to hack and compromise the data. </li>
<li> There is no single computer which when crashed would bring down the enter blockchain. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> Transparency and Security on Blockchains </h4>
<p> Blockchain platforms ensure transparency by having multiple copies of the transaction data. Because the data is decentralized, no central authority can dictate or manipulate the system</p>
<br>
<p> Blockchain platforms ensure security by making use of consensus mechanisms, cryptography, and decentralization.</p>

<h3> Part Four </h3>
<h4> Difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum </h4>.
<p>Bitcoin was made to be a platform to allow peer-to-peer digital currency exchange. Ethereum was made to allow Smart Contracts automate transactions.</p>

<h4> Layer 2 Solutions</h4>
<p> Layer 2 solutions improve scalability by making some of the transactions "off-chain", meaning there is less load on the main chain.</p>
<p> A popular Layer 2 solution is Eclipse; it employs the Solana blockchain to scale up the Ethereum blockchain. </p>
<p> Another Layer 2 solution is the Metis Blockchain which bundles up multiple transactions off-chain before sending a roll-up of the transactions to the main Ethereum blockchain</p>
