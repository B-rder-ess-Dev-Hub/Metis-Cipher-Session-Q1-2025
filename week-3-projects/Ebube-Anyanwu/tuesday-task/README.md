### Verified contract address: 0x23D4D86Da3498A4B1D625742125D4bA46768F6b6

### Difference between =, ==, and === in Solidity.
1. = is the assignment operator used to assign values to variables.
2. == is the equality comparison operator used to check if two values are equal. It returns true if the values are the same, otherwise it returns false.
3. === is the strict equality comparison operator used to check if two values are the same and of the same data type. However it does not exist in Solidity.
