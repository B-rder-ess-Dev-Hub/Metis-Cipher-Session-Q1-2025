# Difference between `=`, `==`, and `===` in Solidity

1. `=` : is used assign a value to something for instance a variable is assigned a value with the single equal to sign. Example uint public name = 50. The sign here assigns "50" to the variable "name".

2. `==` : This is the equality operator and is used to check if two operands are equal. Example x==5, it checks wether x is equal to 5

3. `===`: This operator doesn't exist in Solidity but it is used in other programming languages to perform strict equality checking. That is it is used to check if both values as well as their data types are the same.
