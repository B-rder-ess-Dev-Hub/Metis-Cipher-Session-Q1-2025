# Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented-that it organizes and structures code around objects and their interactions.
, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that govern the behavior of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is designed to write smart contract on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript. With Solidity, you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions,  and multi-signature wallets.

Note: blind auction is a situation whereby bidders of a property or art submit their bid prices without knowing the bid of others elctronically, The highest bidder gets the property
