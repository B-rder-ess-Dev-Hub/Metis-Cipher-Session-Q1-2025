About Me
Name: Saviour Philip Ukoh

Introduction
Hi, I'm Saviour Philip Ukoh, a backend (JavaScript, TypeScript - NestJS, ExpressJS) and smart contract developer with a passion for learning new technologies. I've learned and built a few APIs and contracts on Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum network, and Solana chain, but I still aim to become more proficient in these areas.

In my free time, I create content to entertain my followers on Facebook, TikTok, and my YouTube channel.

Expectations
I joined this program to enhance my skills, deepen my knowledge of Web3 development, and gain hands-on experience in the field. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share similar goals, and I look forward to learning new concepts and techniques that will help me grow as a developer

Experience So Far
The program has been both engaging and insightful. While I already had some familiarity with GitHub, the lessons have provided a deeper understanding of its functionalities and how to effectively use it. I'm excited to continue learning and look forward to applying the knowledge gained in the upcoming weeks.
