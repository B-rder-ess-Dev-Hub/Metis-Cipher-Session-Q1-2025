# Week 0: GitHub and Introduction

Welcome to Week 0 of our training program! This week, we focused on learning GitHub, a critical tool for collaborative development. Your task for this week's project is to create an "About Me" file and contribute it to the training repository.

## Instructions for Week 0 Project

### 1. Create Your "About Me" File
Your task is to create a file in the `week-0` folder with the following details:

**File Name**: Use your full name for the file name (e.g., `john-doe.md`).

**Content**: In the file, include:
- A short introduction about yourself (e.g., background, hobbies, etc.).
- Your expectations for joining the program.
- Your experience in the program so far (even if it’s just Week 0).

#### Example:
```markdown
# About Me

**Name**: John Doe

## Introduction
Hi, I'm John Doe, a software developer with a passion for learning new technologies. I enjoy solving problems and working on innovative projects.

## Expectations
I joined this program to enhance my skills in Web3 development and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

## Experience So Far
So far, the program has been exciting. Learning GitHub in Week 0 has been a great start, and I'm looking forward to the weeks ahead.
