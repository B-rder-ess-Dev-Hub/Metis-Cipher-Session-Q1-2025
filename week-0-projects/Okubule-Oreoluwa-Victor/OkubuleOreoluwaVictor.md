# ABOUT ME


Name: OKUBULE OREOLUWA VICTOR


#INTRODUCTION
Hello BorderlessDevs, My name is Oreoluwa Victor... i am currently a 300 level computer science undergraduate student in Adeleke university Nigeria. my introductory programming language in which i have a personal experience with is the C programming language and it has been my personal favorite languguage to write in because i believe much in its simplicity, i have had interest in studying low level programs and computer hardware behaivior, hence my little knowledge about assembly language programming also....
i enjoy writing code and solving coding puzzles.. and would love to expand my knowledge to the max whereever i can.


#EXPECTATIONS
i joined this program to expand my knowledge into the web3 space and possibly build a career from it.

#EXPERIENCE SO FAR
my experience in the program has been quite fascinating and relaxing around borderless community.
