# About Me

**Name**: Macaulay Amarachi Blossom

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Macaulay Amarachi Blossom, a software developer with a passion for learning new technologies. I've always loved tech and wanted to be a coder. I've learnt a few languages but I still want to be well versed in them and also venture into web3. For my hobbies, I don't really have much. I'm a really shy person so I'm mostly indoors but I really love watching cartoons and movies, animes too. I also love listening to music.

## Expectations
I joined this program to develop my skills, learn more about Web3 development and be able to work with people who have the same visions as I do.

## Experience So Far
So far, the program has been interesting and exciting. Though before now I already knew a bit about GitHub, Miss Glory Praise still managed to break it down so well for us and I'm looking forward to how she'll simplify the remaining lessons in the weeks ahead.
